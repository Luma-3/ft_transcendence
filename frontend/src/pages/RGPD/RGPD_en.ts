      <p class="mb-2">
        Our online gaming application (Pong game) allows users to create an account and log in.
        The personal data collected during registration is necessary to manage your account
        and improve your gaming experience. We collect the following information:

        <li><strong>Username</strong>: your public identifier in the game.</li>
        <li><strong>Email address</strong>: used for account verification and two-factor authentication.</li>
        <li><strong>Password</strong>: stored in hashed form (unreadable) to ensure security.</li>
        <li><strong>Google profile picture</strong>: Only the link to your profile photo is retrieved, and only if you sign up via Google.</li>
        <li><strong>Google ID</strong>: unique identifier of your Google account, used for authentication.</li>
